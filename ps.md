Problem Statement Title: AI-Powered Delivery Post Office Identification System: The wide,
evolving delivery network of the Post Office makes it difficult for customers to write the
correct pin code on postal items for delivery. The Post Office also merges pincodes together
to mechanize and streamline delivery in the emerging volume and mix of mail handled at
different stages, including the point of delivery. An intelligent solution powered by AI is
needed to meet the dynamic design of the supply chain for both customers and operators
within India Post.
Description 1: The Department of Post in India boasts the world's largest postal network,
with over 165,000 post offices. Through nearly 19,000 pin codes across the country the
postal network manages the delivery of postal items across its network. One common issue
is the mismatch between the specified Delivery Post Office name and the area PIN code on
mail items, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction.The delivery network design
keeps on evolving as Nodal Delivery Centres and Delivery Hubs are introduced to bring in
more efficiency in operations. From the perspective of the customer, the challenge is two
fold: (a) to know the correct Pin Code, which is itself a challeng; (b) the dynamic nature of
operations inside with merged pin codes etc for all or certain categories of mail is also a
challenge. Though the customer does not need to bother about (b), the internal system of
India Post needs to take care of both issues (a) and (b) for efficient and correct delivery at all
times.
Description 2: Postal services are essential for various government, financial, educational,
corporate, and public entities, both in urban and rural areas. Despite the widespread use of
postal services, inaccurate addressing persists, hampering efficient delivery. Each mail item
must clearly indicate the recipient's Delivery Post Office name and area Pin Code. However,
inconsistencies in this information often result in misrouted mail, with approximately 5% of
articles handled daily at distribution hubs containing incorrect Pin Codes. Even if correct
Pincodes are provided as per information available with the customer, there is a mismatch in
the internal operations as the constant upgradation of delivery network with Nodal Delivery
Centres with merged pincodes etc makes it too dynamic for internal operators to keep pace
with the changes. This leads to mistakes, delays and wasteful movement of mail pieces in
the system. Expected Solution: An AI-based scanning solution is proposed to identify the
correct delivery location for mail items with unclear or mismatched addresses. This system
will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret address
information, determining the appropriate Delivery Post Office based on available data. By
automating the identification process, this solution aims to improve last-mile delivery
efficiency, reducing delays and enhancing customer satisfaction. Having taken care of the
first problem, the system is also expected to align with internal operational databases for
clubbing and mapping of different pincodes for delivery purpose and thereby suggest the
right destination for dispatch and delivery of the articles.
